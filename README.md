//Create your repository on the github platform

//Copy the https link

//in the folder of your local repo: git remote add origin.

//If you already have everything added to the assembly and you have already made a commitment, you only have to upload it to github with: git push -u origin master

//you should be asked for github username and password

//if you do not have your name and email configured, do it with the commands:

//git config - global username "Your name"

//git config: global user email "your email"

//git branch: See the existing branches and which one you are currently in

//git branch something: Create a new branch called "something"

//git checkout branch_name: changes to the called branch as indicated in "branch_name"

//git merge branch: merge changes from a branch you are currently on

//git pull: used to download and merge changes from the remote repository

$ git help <verb>
  
$ git <verb> --help
  
$ man git-<verb> --- Example: $ git help config

//git checkout                         To see your files
